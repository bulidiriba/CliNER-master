Understanding the difference between clinical trials and medical treatments is critical.
Medical care is intrinsically different from clinical research studies.
Medical care is administered by doctors through a personal regimen that is specific to a patient and his or her condition.
Clinical research studies follow a protocol that applies to all participants,
whether it proves to be advantageous to a certain patient or not.
